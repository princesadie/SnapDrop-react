# Contributing to React Native Material Kit

Thank you for contributing to [RNMK]! :metal:

## Reporting Bugs

- Before filing a new task, try to make sure it doesn't already exist.
- Provide environment informations, such as RN version, RNMK version, OS version etc.
- Provide error logs or stack trace if possible. For UI issues, screenshots are helpful.
- Try to provide a reduced test case. Either a public repository with a runnable example or a [React Native Playground](https://rnplay.org/) snippet.

## Component Contributions

- Test your components on both iOS and Android platform
- ***Try*** to keep compatible with the oldest version of RN which RNMK supports ([Where to find it?][rnmk-rn-version])
- Demonstrating the new components in [RNMK Demos]
- Add showcases and brief examples to `README.md`
- Components should be organized in alphabet order
